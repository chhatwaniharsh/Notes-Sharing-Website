    <p>Hello Visitor...<br>
        This is Simple Notes Sharing Site developed by <b>Harsh Chhatwani</b> using Python Django, Html, Css, Bootstrap and Sqlite.<br>
        Welcome to Study Notes Sharing Site! ðŸŽ“ <br>
        Weâ€™re a community of students helping each other by sharing notes, summaries, and study resources. Our goal is simple â€“ make learning easier and more collaborative.
        Whether you missed a lecture, want to revise quickly, or just learn better with notes, youâ€™ll find everything here, shared by students like you. <br>
        We know the struggle â€“ last-minute exams, messy notes, and endless textbooks. Thatâ€™s why we created Study Notes Sharing Site, a space where students come together to share notes, ideas, and study hacks.<br>
        Think of it as your digital notebook, open 24/7, filled with resources from students across different courses.
